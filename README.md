I have built a complete Lost and found app, from which user can report and find his lost items. The backend is in Firebase and it uses a few APIs as well.
Some features of this app are:
1. Publish your Lost/Found items in your college community.
2.All Sign in functionalities (Email confirmation,Forgot password,etc).
3.Check your posts, View your profile.
4.claim your items found out by someone in just one click.
